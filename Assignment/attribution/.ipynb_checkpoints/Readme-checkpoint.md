## Attribution classification
In this part we're working on the attribution dataset.

### Running the code
For runing the code you need to check you have at least *python version* of `3.11`.
We ran our code on *python version* `3.12.7`.   
In addition check you have the libreries that needed. If not you can install them by running this commands:
```bash
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install sklearn
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
``` 
Another way, in the notebook there is all the installation needed, just take down the comment sign and run the block.

### Dataset path
Please check that you have the datasets in the same folder/directory of the code.  
If not you can or update the path to the right directory, or add the datasets to the same folder that the code is in.

### Output
In the end the output will be a new csv file that is a copy of the validation csv files, but in here we'll have another column of the predicted labels.
